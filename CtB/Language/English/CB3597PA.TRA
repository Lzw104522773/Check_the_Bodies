@1 = ~<GABBER>, I bring word from my own mistress.  Partir cet endroit.... part d'ici- leave this place.  Do not investigate the workings of demons too deeply, less you apprendre que vous ne voulez pas savoir- you find what you fear most.~
@2 = ~I leave you now, <GABBER>, and pray you do not succumb to the diable on the falaise-  on the clifftop.~
@3 = ~What?  What is here, Parisa?~
@4 = ~There is nothing here at this farm which could harm me.~
@5 = ~Thanks for the advice, Parisa.  But I'd prefer to take a look around.~
@6 = ~Yes, your words are wise.  I will leave, Parisa, and take your warning with caution.~
@7 = ~That, dear <GABBER>, I shall not tell you.  It is not for day-walkers to know.  Now, aller- go- and do not return.~
@8 = ~Dear <GABBER>, you are as naive about the workings of such evil.  This place is not for day-walkers.  Please, <GABBER>, Je mendie de vous- I beg of you- my mistress begs you, leave Neng's.  Leave it and never return.~
@9 = ~<GABBER>, you have always been tÃªtu- stubborn- but in this matter, I must insist.  This is not a place for day-walkers to be.  Leave here, leave Neng's, and for all that you hold saint et votre vie- holy and your life- do not return.~
@10 = ~That is good, <GABBER>.  You too are a wise day-walker.  Take my mon avertissement- my warning- with you throughout your travels.  Rester loin- stay away- from Neng's.~
