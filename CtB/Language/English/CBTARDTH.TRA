@1   = ~Hold!  You have enough arrows and spells sighted on your neck to take down a giant!~
@2   = ~Hold!  You have enough arrows and spells sighted on you and your companions to take down a giant!~
@3   = ~The slightest unfriendly action on your part, and you will be dead before the third shafts are fitted to bowstrings.~
@4   = ~Speak:  What is your purpose here in this Forest?~
@5   = ~Not to worry, Friend.  I mean you no harm.~
@6   = ~I've been sent on a quest by Elhan.  We are trying to dislodge the enemies of Elves from Suldanessellar.~
@7   = ~My name is <CHARNAME> and my business is my own.~
@8   = ~My name is <CHARNAME>, in search of adventure.~
@9   = ~Who the hell do you think you are to threaten me?~
@10  = ~I care not for your idle threats.  You do not know who you are speaking to.~
@11  = ~Company! Arm yourselves!  We have unexpected visitors!~
@12  = ~You there!  Hold where you are!~
@13  = ~At this moment, there are enough arrows pointed in your direction to take down a giant.~
@14  = ~Of course not.  Yet you must forgive my wariness.  These are troubled times, and we are the caretakers of this region.~
@15  = ~Now, answer the question.  What are your intentions here in the Forest?~
@16  = ~Elhan?  You know the Warden of Suldanessellar?  How could you know him?~
@17  = ~He has sought my aid in recovering the Elven city.~
@18  = ~I have given him the means to gain entry into Suldanessellar.~
@19  = ~Have you succeeded?  The Elven city is of utmost importance.  If you know how to gain entry, Elf-Friend, then you must do it.~
@20  = ~We will attend our own tasks here, for now, but if you are able to assist us at a later time, return then.~
@21  = ~Go then, Elf-Friend, liberate Suldanessellar.~
@22  = ~If Suldanessellar is found, Elf-Friend, then go!  Help Elhan!~
@23  = ~If the city can be liberated and Ellesime rescued, there is nothing of more importance to the region.~
@24  = ~We will attend our task here.  If you can return to assist, you will be welcome, but the Elven city must be liberated.~
@25  = ~True.  True enough.~
@26  = ~Very well, then, <CHARNAME>.  I respect your privacy.~
@27  = ~Come, let me introduce myself.  I am Tardeth Llanistaph, the unofficial leader of the Company of Eight, a ranger caring for our great lands- flora and fauna, and these are my companions.~
@28  = ~Right you are, my good Rashemaar.  As I was saying, this is my companion, Marilyn Haresdown.~
@29  = ~This is my companion, Marilyn Haresdown.~
@30  = ~Stand down, Marilyn.  All is well, right now.  This young Elf practicing with his bow is my good friend, Sylvanus Moondrop.  Sylvanus, do you have a moment?~
@31  = ~Sylvanus doesn't spend much time without a bow in his hand.  And he's quite protective of his horse, so don't spook it.~
@32  = ~Next we have our diminutive friend, but without a doubt not useless, Paddy Stoutfellow.  Watch your pockets 'round him, else you'll find that you're missing your trousers.~
@33  = ~Yes, yes, Paddy.  We'll duel another day though.  Let me finish speaking with these good folk here.~
@34  = ~The only real mage of the group, and probably the most learned of us about botony, Lawantha Silendia is the only one of not originally from Tethyr.~
@35  = ~Sorry, Lawantha, I was just pointing you out to our guests.  Nevermind.~
@36  = ~Quite talkative, once you get to know her.  Finally we have our two druids, Arkaneus Silvermane and Manny Arbustle.~
@37  = ~And that is our little Company of Eight.~
@38  = ~Now then, my new friend, what brings you here to the Forest of Tethyr?~
@39  = ~Adventure eh?  As are we, yet we, the Company of Eight, strive for good and stability in Tethyr.  Whether of not you reach for the same goals, I do not know, but we will leave that be for now.~
@40  = ~As of late, that task has become difficult for us.~
@41  = ~The Elves of Suldanessellar have been displaced; rumors of war have also reached our ears.~
@42  = ~On top of this, we've stumbled upon this barred door that was not here during our last visit to the Forest.~
@43  = ~We've investigated it, and realized that what we may be forced to deal with is beyond our skills.~
@44  = ~What?  What is it that you've found?~
@45  = ~Apparently The Cult of the Dragon has taken up residence in the cave and dungeon below.~
@46  = ~They have resurrected a dragon, but beyond that, I don't know their plans.~
@47  = ~What do you plan to do about it, Tardeth?~
@48  = ~We've got to try to stop them.~
@49  = ~There isn't any other choice.~
@50  = ~But I fear we might not succeed.~
@51  = ~What if I help?  Together we could defeat them.~
@52  = ~Good luck to you then.~
@53  = ~I am Tardeth, leader of the Company of Eight.  And you are trespassing in the Forest of Tethyr.~
@54  = ~My companions and I care for this Forest.~
@55  = ~If you have no honorable business here, I ask you to leave before we must make you leave.~
@56  = ~Sorry to bother you and your forest.~
@57  = ~We seem to have started off wrong.  My name is <CHARNAME> and I travel the lands in search of adventure.~
@58  = ~That would be for the best.~
@59  = ~Who you are makes no difference to me.  What you intend to do does.~
@60  = ~I intend for you to stop harassing me.  Forceably, if necessary.~
@61  = ~As you wish.  Friends!~
@62  = ~We are beset by bandits!  Arm yourselves!~
@63  = ~We will endeavor to remove the Cult from the ruins, and if you want to help, your assistance is welcome.~
@64  = ~Otherwise, you must excuse us.  We have preperations to make.~
@65  = ~We had planned on removing the Cult alone, but your help would be a great asset.~
@66  = ~Enough.  If <CHARNAME> wants to help, we should be grateful.~
@67  = ~Very well.  We still have preperations to make, as I am sure you would like to do as well.~
@68  = ~Let us attend our rest before we make an assault then.~
@69  = ~Speak with me when you are ready, and together we will attack the Cult's stronghold.~
@70  = ~So, my new friend, you have returned.  Might you have some free time?~
@71  = ~Perhaps if you've no other pressing business, you could assist us in our assault on the Cult's stronghold?~
@72  = ~Sure.  I don't have anything else to do.  What is it you need?~
@73  = ~No.  I don't think I have the time right now.~
@74  = ~If you change your mind, or have the chance to assist us, your help would be most welcome.~
@75  = ~You have returned?~
@76  = ~I hope you still have honorable intentions here.~
@77  = ~Like I told you, there is no need for you to worry, Friend.  I mean you no harm.~
@78  = ~I've been sent on a quest by Elhan.  We are trying to dislodge the enemies of Elves from Suldanessellar, which is quite honorable.~
@79  = ~I told you, my business is my own.~
@80  = ~As I already mentioned, I am simply in search of adventure.~
@81  = ~Elf-Friend!  Good to see you again!~
@82  = ~You must return to Elhan and help him.  Liberate Suldanessellar and free the Queen.  Go, go, <CHARNAME>!~
@83  = ~We just received words from the forest elves that Suldanessellar and her People are safe.  You are truly a hero.~
@84  = ~ We shall have to make you an honorary member of The Company of Eight.~
@85  = ~Better they be with us than against us, Marilyn.  <CHARNAME>, you have our thanks and our companionship whenever you join with us to break bread or tell tales of adventure.~
@86  = ~All of us will call you friend from now on.  Regardless of whether you help us now or not.~
@87  = ~What do you mean "help you?"  What is wrong, Tardeth?~
@88  = ~To tell you the truth, things are normally fairly quiet in the Forest of Tethyr.~
@89  = ~Up until recently.~
@90  = ~When the Elves of Suldanessellar were displaced, other power groups attempted to fill the void.  We've also heard rumors of war.~
@91  = ~Now that the People are safe in their homes, you have brought a devestating blow to evil and chaos in the region, but now, if you want, you can help us make another blow to evil.~
@92  = ~You see, this barred door secures the Cult of the Dragon's outpost in the region.~
@93  = ~So, are you ready to enter the Cult's stronghold?~
@94  = ~No, not yet, Tardeth.~
@95  = ~Yes.  We're all set.  Let's go.~
@96  = ~Let me know when you are ready.~
@97  = ~Everyone ready?~
@98  = ~Very well, <CHARNAME>, here's what I'll do.  I will bust down the door with a little magic from Lawantha and rush in.  I'll go first, with Marilyn beside me.  Sylvanus will come next, with Paddy to provide us with a covering fire.  The others- Lawantha, Arkanus, and Manny- will follow.~
@99  = ~You come after them, and postition yourself as you want.~
@100 = ~You and your companions come after we've secured the entrance.~
@101 = ~We'll fight alongside you, and we trust your tactical strategies, but don't expect us to act as fodder for the Cult's operatives.~
@102 = ~We're in this together, and our losses are your losses, as your losses are our losses.~
@103 = ~Let's not think about that though.~
@104 = ~We will all do our best to defeat the Cult and share in the rewards.~
@105 = ~So, are you sure you are ready?~
@106 = ~No.~
@107 = ~Yes.~
@108 = ~I think it would be best if you let me go first, and you all wait here.~
@109 = ~Hurry up then.  We're waiting on you.~
@110 = ~All right then.  Let's do it.~
@111 = ~Not a chance, <CHARNAME>.  We're not about to let you get all the glory.~
@112 = ~It's either with us, or we go alone.~
@113 = ~So, do you want in?~
@114 = ~Yes, that's fine then.~
@115 = ~Not right now.  Wait for me to help though.~
@116 = ~No way, Lawantha.  I could never be as good as Sylvanus.  How many times has he covered you with a few quick shots while you've been casting a spell?~
@117 = ~What?  What do you see Marilyn?~
@118 = ~Damn.  All right everyone, step carefully.  We've got some sort of trap here.  Nothing that will hurt you, but don't leave any extra prints on the ground.~
@119 = ~See this, <CHARNAME>, the floor is clean.  The dirt has been smoothed, and anyone who wants to check can see if someone passed without erasing their footprints.~
@120 = ~Little busy here, Sylvanus.  There take that one out!~
@121 = ~Well done everybody.  Let's grab our gear and get out of here.  <CHARNAME>, we'll meet you back outside in the Forest.~
@122 = ~When I first met you, I wasn't sure what to make of you.  But now I'm glad I didn't order Marilyn and Sylvanus to stick you with all those arrows.~
@123 = ~Faerûn would not be what it is without you, and the Forest of Tethyr is safer now that the Cult of the Dragon has been removed.~
@124 = ~You have been of great help to us, and I fear that we may not have succeeded without you.  Here, please, take this sword that has served me so well.~
@125 = ~Use it with pride, <CHARNAME>.  It's a formidable weapon to right wrongs.  Perhaps we will meet again sometime.~
@126 = ~Come, Company of Eight, we must go and see to the elves.~
@127 = ~The Famous Company of Eight

I've spent my last adventure fighting alongside the Company of Eight as we tried to remove a cell of the Cult of the Dragon which had taken up residence in an abandoned dungeon below the Forest of Tethyr.  All of the Company- Marilyn, Paddy, the elf Moondrop, Lawantha, the two druids Manny and Arkanus, and Tardeth were skilled fighters, and we successfully defeated the Cult.  I must admit, fighting with such a skilled band of adventurers was a treat, and I hope that I get the chance to do so again.~
@128 = ~The Famous Company of Eight

  I have finally met the Company of Eight that I have heard so much about.  This legendary adventuring group of Tethyr has stumbled upon a stronghold being used by the Cult of the Dragon.  I was invited to help them remove the Cult, and when I am ready to take on this quest, the Company's leader, Tardeth, has instructed me to tell him when I am ready.
  I hope that when I am ready, seeking adventure and battle with the Company of Eight is something that is worthy of my skills.~
@274 = ~Minsc is always pleased to meet a fellow Ranger!  The more rangers Faerûn has, the bigger butt-kicking evil will get!~
@275 = ~<CHARNAME>!  This is not right.  Fellow do-gooder's are in need of help to give evil a good beating, and you refuse them?  No, <CHARNAME>, we should help them so change your mind quickly.~
@448 = ~<CHARNAME>, after all we've been through, you'll stand by and watch the evil Cult do whatever they want?  You're wrong in not helping the Company.~
@450 = ~I must insist, <CHARNAME>, that we offer our services to the Company.  This is something that we can spend time doing, and is a worthwhile quest.~
@451 = ~I agree with the others.  I must insist, <CHARNAME>, that we offer our services to the Company.  This is something that we can spend time doing, and is a worthwhile quest.~
@668 = ~Our scarred friend is right, <CHARNAME>.~
@669 = ~This is not something that I can, with good conscience, let alone.  We must help the Company.~
