@18  = ~Ah, a self-pleasing wench?  Am I to assume then, that we can't get you a room here and let you rumple the bedclothes?  We can see if your rod of earthquakes is more powerful than my wand.~ [CBCWL505]

@28  = ~Strumpet!  You've dealt with enough Cowled Wizards before to know well-enough that that is not how things will happen.  Now, will you perform the task or am I going to get the chance to muss some bedclothes and tickle you out of your shift?~ [CBCWL515]
@29  = ~Bint!  Stop wasting my time.~ [CBCWL516]
@30  = ~Then let's bundle you right upstairs and we'll see if I can't give you some new bruises after you hike up those skirts of yours.~ [CBCWL517]

@33  = ~After we took away that whore calling herself a mage, we discovered the fox-faced bint was experimenting on Hakeshars.  Others in the Cowled Wizard ranks have begun duplicating the twits work, and as of yet I have not been told of any of their findings.~ [CBCWL520]
@34  = ~I know a fellow Wizard colleague of mine has completed some reports on these studies, and I want to know what the results are.  You, my rumpled strumpet, are to go to the Cowled Wizards apartments and find me these reports.  Return them to me when you have the documents about the Hakeshar research.~ [CBCWL521]

@42  = ~I told you:  be a willing wench and do what I wanted, I'd make you something more than just a farmer's daughter.  I won't break my word.  What would you like me to teach you:  would you rather know how to memorize a greater number of spells than your meager intellect normally can, would you like to learn how to improve your spellcasting times, or would you like to learn how to enchant a normal bladed weapon into something magical?~ [CBCWL528]
@43  = ~I'd like to know how to memorize an additional spell per level.~
@44  = ~I would think an increased spellcasting speed will be more beneficial.~

@48  = ~Very well.  I will show you on how to quickly and efficiently cast spells.~ [CBCWL534]
@49  = ~There you are.  You, my pretty little maid, may now cast spells at a faster rate than most other wizards.~ [CBCWL535]
@50  = ~Very well.  I will teach you, my fine looking strumpet, how to magically enchant a bladed weapon, be it sword, dagger, axe, or halberd.~ [CBCWL536]
@51  = ~There you are, dear.  You now have the ability to enchant normal, non-magical, undestroyed bladed weapons into magical weapons.  Just remember, you must have the item that you want to enchant on your person otherwise the enchanting will not work properly.  And remember, it only works on weapons that you hold in your hand to attack, not anything that can be thrown.~ [CBCWL537]
@52  = ~If it isn't my pretty little trull.  Care to join me for an hour or two and we can bundle you up to the maid's room?~ [CBCWL538]

@54  = ~Give me a kiss, trollop, and we can do some things together.~ [CBCWL540]

@56  = ~Like I said, I have things that need to be attended.~
@57  = ~And I have things that need to be tended.  You, my feisty wench, can help me with that.  Are you sure a strumpet like you doesn't want to have a tumble?~ [CBCWL543]
@58  = ~Not very likely.  I would much rather get eaten by Dragons in the Forest of Mir than let your snake roam through my grassy fields.~
@59  = ~Fine.  Let's hurry this up.  I really need to rescue a friend who is trapped in an Asylum.~
@60  = ~No need to worry about that, my little maid.  I need to rescue a friend trapped in my trousers.~ [CBCWL546]
@61  = ~There'd be no chance of getting Trapped or Imprisoned if you spent the night.  The only thing you'd have to worry about is losing your balance in the Grease.~ [CBCWL547]
@62  = ~What a puffed up popinjay you are!   I'll paddle your bottom some other time then.~ [CBCWL548]
@63  = ~I think a dragon would be quite interested in you.  Dragons eat maidens, and I can't blame them.  I can help protect you from dragons.~ [CBCWL549]
@64  = ~Fine.  I really need to rescue a friend who is trapped in an Asylum.~
@65  = ~Don't take such a tone like that with me, popinjay.  If you want me to teach you something, don't expect me to do something for free.~ [CBCWL551]
@66  = ~Stoney-eyed trull!  Don't expect me to teach a bint such as yourself anything out of the kindness of my heart.~ [CBCWL552]
@67  = ~You think I'm going to let you treat me like a two-gold whore? No.  I'll teach a chit like you something, but don't expect that I'm going to waste my time without getting something in return.~ [CBCWL553]
@68  = ~I'll tell you what.  I'll teach you a useful skill, but I want something in return.  I'll give you a choice:  either complete a task for me, or you'll have to be a willing wench and take a tumble with me.~ [CBCWL554]
@69  = ~Strumpet!  You've dealt with enough Cowled Wizards before to know well-enough that that is not how things will happen.  Now, will you perform the task or am I going to get the chance to give you a few bruises and hear you howl?~ [CBCWL556]
@70  = ~You're nothing more than a puffed-up popinjay.  I'll trot you off to court one of these days.~ [CBCWL556]
@71  = ~Then give me a kiss, trollop, and I'll tickle you right out of those skirts.~ [CBCWL557]
@72  = ~Some other time I'll fold your skirts above your hips again.~ [CBCWL558]

@74  = ~I have been tracking a minor magical item that I would truly like to take possession of.  It's a simple staff, and only has minor magical abilities, but I do want it for my own.~ [CBCWL560]
@75  = ~At this time, I have not the information of where the staff is or who possesses it, but I do have some knowledge of where it could be or who had it recently.  First, an outlawed mage named Rayic had the staff, a trull named Faldorn had it at one time, and I know it was possessed by a fine strumpet named Deirdre.  I'll put the strap to her one of these days.  You, my little chit, are to bring me this staff.~ [CBCWL561]
@76  = ~Hello again, lightskirt.  Did you bring me my staff?~ [CBCWL562]
@77  = ~Silly bint.  Wouldn't even remember her own name if it wasn't pinned to her petticoats.~ [CBCWL563]
@78  = ~If you don't bring me my staff quickly, you fox-faced bint, I may decide to stuff you down a well to cool your head and leave you there.~ [CBCWL564]
@79  = ~I am pleased at what you have done, wench. Give it to me.~ [CBCWL565]
@80  = ~I promised if you did something for me, I'd do something for you.  What is it that you want me to teach you:  would you rather know how to perform advanced alchemy, that is, concocting potent elixirs and potions, would you like to learn improved methods of enchantment, or would you like to further improve your spell casting times?~ [CBCWL566]
@81  = ~I think I would like to learn the art of alchemy.~
@82  = ~I would be quite grateful, if you know what I mean, if you taught me how to enchant weapons.~
@83  = ~If you teach me how to cast spells faster, I just might have to prove to you how much I appreciate your instruction.~
@84  = ~Very well.  I will show you how to mix chemicals and powders to create potions.~ [CBCWL570]
@85  = ~There you are.  You may now create a variety of magical potions.~ [CBCWL571]
@86  = ~Very well.  I will instruct you the advanced techniques used to enchant bladed weapons.~ [CBCWL572]
@87  = ~There you are.  You may now enchant bladed weapons to be even more powerful.  Just remember, twit, that you must have the item that you want to enchant on your person otherwise the enchantment will fail.  And remember, it only works on weapons that you hold in your hand to attack, not anything that can be thrown.~ [CBCWL573]
@88  = ~Very well.  I will teach you how to improve your spellcasting speed.~ [CBCWL574]

@91  = ~Would you be willing to teach me something?~

@94  = ~I don't suppose a lively trollop like you would want to buff the helm of a cyclops?~ [CBCWL580]
@95  = ~Are you going to teach me anything?~
@96  = ~Not very likely.  I would much rather be touched by a Banite's Finger of Death than your Bolt of Glory.~
@97  = ~Like I said, right now I have a lot of adventuring gear that needs to be cared for.~
@98  = ~Would you mind caring for my equipment as well?  Sheath my sword?  Empty my quiver?  Pet my familiar?  Count the gems in my Bag of Holding?~ [CBCWL584]
@99  = ~Can you just teach me something else?~
@100 = ~Not very likely.  I would much rather enjoy my own Spell Thrust than your Black Blade of Disaster.~
@101 = ~I think I have a minute or two to spare.  I haven't petted my familiar in a while.~
@102 = ~Then gather your skirts up over those hips of yours, chit, and I'll tickle you right out of that shift.~ [CBCWL588]
@103 = ~Have no fear, trollop.  My blade is anything but Phantom.~ [CBCWL589]
@104 = ~Can you just teach me something?~
@105 = ~What a feisty twit you are!  So, you're into the group ritual type of thing?  I suppose I could get into that.~ [CBCWL591]
@106 = ~Look, are you going to teach me something or not?~
@107 = ~Ah, the wench is self sufficient then?  Am I to assume then, that we can't get you a room here and see if your Spell Thrust is bigger than my Black Blade.~ [CBCWL593]
@108 = ~Can you just teach me something new?~
@109 = ~Yes, my pretty little strumpet, I did.  I could teach a trull like you something, but don't expect that I'm going to waste my time without getting something in return.~ [CBCWL595]
@110 = ~I'll tell you what.  I'll teach you a useful skill, but I want something in return.  I'll give you a choice:  either complete a task for me, or you'll have to be a nice strumpet and rumple the bedclothes with me.~ [CBCWL596]

@113 = ~Gather up your skirts, trollop, and we'll go right up to the maid's room and see if we can't get you with child.~ [CBCWL599]
@114 = ~Claim I got you with child to anyone, chit, and I'll stuff you down a well.~ [CBCWL600]
@115 = ~What a willing wench you are.  I'd much rather have the chance to fondle a pretty little maid like yourself, but I'll tell you what I need.~ [CBCWL601]
@116 = ~This is a fairly easy task, but requires the utmost discretion.~ [CBCWL602]
@117 = ~I want you to contact the temples in and about Amn and find a potion or scroll or something that will cure me of this rash some painted lady of the night gave me.  Return anything you find that may cure a malady to me here at once.~ [CBCWL603]
@118 = ~Well?  Has the trollop brought me a cure for maladies?~ [CBCWL604]
@119 = ~If I have to tell you again, I'm going to put the birch to your bottom and listen to you howl.~ [CBCWL605]
@120 = ~If you don't hurry and find me a cure for maladies, I'm going to hang you up like a sow to wait for the knife or strangle you, trull.  Now, get out of my sight before I decide to start using andiron on your behind.~ [CBCWL606]
@121 = ~Excellent work, wench. Give it to me.~ [CBCWL607]
@122 = ~I promised that if you were a good little lightskirt and did something for me, I'd do something to repay you.  I'll teach you one more magical skill.  What would you like me to teach you:  would you rather know how to memorize a greater number of spells than a trull with spellcasting abilities normally can, would you like to learn how to improve your spellcasting times in a way that will allow you to cast two spells nearly simultaneously, or would you like to learn how to cause the recollection of a spell without re-memorizing it?~ [CBCWL608]
@123 = ~I want you to teach me how to recall a spell.~
@124 = ~Very well.  I will try to teach you how to increase your memory.~ [CBCWL610]
@125 = ~There, my dear.  Your mental capacity to memorize spells now exceeds the norm for a pretty girl of your intellect.~ [CBCWL611]
@126 = ~Very well.  I will try to teach you how to double the number of spells you cast in a specific time frame.~ [CBCWL612]
@127 = ~There you are.  You may now cast double the number of spells than most other wizards in a single minute.~ [CBCWL613]
@128 = ~Very well.  I will teach you how to recall a spell that you have cast since the last time you studied.~ [CBCWL614]
@129 = ~You must think of yourself like a puffed up popinjay for learning how to recall spells.~ [CBCWL615]
@130 = ~I promised that if you were a good little lightskirt and did something for me, I'd do something to repay you.  I'll teach you one magical skill more.

@131 = ~I'd like you to teach me how to use any item.~
@132 = ~Teaching a mage the ability to use any item is a difficult process.  I will try my best, but cannot guarantee that you will succeed.~ [CBCWL618]
@133 = ~There.  You may now use nearly any item you wish.  Remember, some items that you use like armor will prevent you from casting spells.  Also, it may not be a good idea to use any two handed weapons, since mages were not meant to use some items, the effect on Faerûn may be catastrophic.~ [CBCWL619]
@134 = ~I'm sorry.  Not every mage has the intelligence to learn how to use some items.  I guess you are one of the unlucky ones.~ [CBCWL620]
@135 = ~Unless you're looking for a few more bruises, I'll have nothing to do with a fox-faced chit such as yourself.  Now, get out of my sight before I stuff you down a well.~ [CBCWL621]

@138 = ~Romancing The Wizard

   After solving one of the Cowled Wizard's problems, whereas they were unable to locate a rogue mage casting spells illegaly in Amn without my assistance, one of the Cowls offered to teach me some advanced magery.  Unfortunately, like everyone else I meet in this decadent city, this Cowl wants me to complete a task for him.
   The rogue mage I had caught was experimenting with Hakeshars and the Cowls have continued those experiments.  The mage who offered to teach me wants me to find and bring him the preliminary reports of the experiments that are being conducted.  He expects that I can find them filed in the Asylum, where many of the Cowled Wizards reside and research magic.
   When I find the reports or results, I am to return it to the Cowled Wizard in the Den of Seven Vales.~

@142 = ~Romancing The Wizard

   True to his word, the vulgar Cowled Wizard taught me advanced magical skills.  After delivering reports regarding the Hakeshar research, he gave me a few lessons and offered to teach me something else, provided I perform another task.
   This time, the wizard wants me to locate a staff with some magical abilities.  He does not know precisely where it is, but mentioned that it was owned by a woman druid Faldorn who may have sold it to a merchant in Athkatla named Dierdre, who in turn may have traded it to another mage named Rayic.
   When I find the staff, I am to return to the Cowled Wizard in the Den of Seven Vales to deliver it to him.~
@143 = ~Romancing The Wizard

@146 = ~Romancing The Wizard

   Twice now I have been tutored by one of the Cowled Wizards.  he has ordered me to complete another task for him if I want to have his instruction again.
   This time, the mage asked me to discretely find a spell or scroll or potion that can cure him of a private disease:  apparently he has had too many contacts with Athkatla's courtesans and has earned himself a rash.  He suggests asking at the temples of Alm first.
   When I find something that can cure him of this embarrassing malady, I am to bring it to him in the Den of the Seven Vales.~
