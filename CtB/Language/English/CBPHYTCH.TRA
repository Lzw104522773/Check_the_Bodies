@1   = ~Oh, hello!  I thought I'd teach you a bit about... about...  umm...~
@2   = ~Fireballs.~
@3   = ~Can you teach me about scribing scrolls?~
@4   = ~How to use a halbard at the level of a grand master.~
@5   = ~Ah, yes.  Fireballs.  Oh, I hate being so absent-minded!  Anyway, Fireballs are a useful trick that can cause great big globs of slime to smother your enemies in.  The gigantic flaming balls of molten rock fly willy-nilly from the sky, and they crash down, causing destruction and ruin in dungeons which are very dark and scary, but if you use a Continual Light spell can actually be pretty with all the glowing moss which won't grow unless the dungeon is damp from where water seeps down through the topsoil.  Earthworms live in the topsoil, and it are these worms that burrow deep into the ground, like an ankheg except that earthworms don't eat people.  Unless you are dead, then the worms will eat you and you won't become undead.  But if you're undead then... WAIT!  Are you undead?   I don't want to be associating with anyone who is undead.~
@6   = ~Never fear, dear Phlydia.  I am not undead.  I am just a little <PRO_GIRLBOY>.~
@7   = ~Um, Phlydia.  Actually, my father asked you to teach me how to scribe scrolls.~
@8   = ~If I were undead, don't you think I would have worms coming out of my eye-sockets?~
@9   = ~Ah, and such a cute little <PRO_GIRLBOY> you are.  Come here, let me pinch your cute cheeks.~
@10  = ~Nobody is going to pinch my cheeks, especially not you, Phlydia.  Now, are you going to teach me about fireballs or not?~
@11  = ~Nobody is going to pinch my cheeks, especially not you, Phlydia.  Now, are you going to teach me about scribing scrolls or not?~
@12  = ~Nobody is going to pinch my cheeks, especially not you, Phlydia.  Now, are you going to teach me how to use a halberd or not?~
@13  = ~Scribing?  Scrolls?  Why would scrolls be scribing?  They're inanimate objects, hence scrolls cannot perform actions.~
@14  = ~Not scrolls scribing!  Scribing Scrolls!  As in, the scribes are scribing the scrolls.~
@15  = ~OH...  Yes, yes.  Those scribing scrolls.  What a wonderful idea, little <PRO_GIRLBOY>!~
@16  = ~I can do this!  I know how to scribe scrolls, and that's an important step in teaching something.  Knowing your material.  ~
@17  = ~A halberd?  You mean those big pointy things with sharp things on the end?  Why would in Mystra's name would you want to know how to use that?  You're too little to be playing with sharp knives.  Besides, your father raised you better than that.  You should know not to poke people with pointy sticks.  Or bananas.~
@18  = ~No, I wouldn't know the first thing about chopping up people with pointy sticks.  How about I teach you something else?~
@19  = ~Can you teach me how to scribe scrolls?~
@20  = ~Can you teach me about Fireballs?~
@21  = ~Your father?  Bha... Er, no, isn't your father dead?~
@22  = ~No, he just left the room for a while.  Now, are you going to teach me about fireballs or not?~
@23  = ~No, he just left the room for a while.  Now, are you going to teach me about scribing scrolls or not?~
@24  = ~No, he just left the room for a while.  Now, are you going to teach me how to use a halberd or not?~
@25  = ~Eye-sockets?  Why yes, I think there might be.  But as I've never actually seen a dragon, I wouldn't know what would be coming out of your eye-sockets if you were a dragon.~
@26  = ~Dragon?  What dragon?~
@27  = ~What are you talking about?  You're confusing me.~
@28  = ~Dragon!?!  Where?  Call the Watchers!!  Summon the mages!  Candlekeep is under attack!  ~
@29  = ~There's no dragon here Phlydia.  Now, are you going to teach me about fireballs or not?~
@30  = ~There's no dragon here Phlydia.  Now, are you going to teach me about scribing scrolls or not?~
@31  = ~There's no dragon here, Phlydia.  Now, are you going to teach me how to use a halberd or not?~
@32  = ~Oh! Why hello. I didn't see you there.  Have you seen my book... Wait. No, that comes a little later in your life.~
@33  = ~Ms. Phlydia?  Are you going to teach me about fireballs or not?~
@34  = ~Ms. Phlydia?  Are you going to teach me about scribing scrolls or not?~
@35  = ~Ms. Phlydia?  Are you going to teach me how to use a halberd or not?~
@36  = ~Let me see.  Well, first, in order to learn how to scribe scrolls, you need to know how to write.  Do you know how to write?~
@37  = ~Umm... yes?~
@38  = ~Of course I can't write you looney.  I'm just a bunch of colored pixels on a mechanical screen which has a bunch of electrons that are shot out of a cathode tube onto a piece of ionized glass in such a way as to create an image of a person which can move about the glass, simulating the effect of motion, although there really is absolutely no motion whatsoever.~
@39  = ~Good.  That's the first step to scribing scrolls.~
@40  = ~I suppose the second step to learning how to scribe scrolls would be knowing how to read.  Or perhaps reading is more important than writing.  What do you think?~
@41  = ~I think you had it right the first time.~
@42  = ~I suppose that reading is more important than writing.~
@43  = ~Can we just cut to the chase and get on with the lesson?~
@44  = ~The first time?  Um...  which one was that?  Oh, nevermind.  We'll get on with the lesson.~
@45  = ~That would probably be for the best.~
@46  = ~All right, little <PRO_GIRLBOY>... wait, I can't keep calling you little <PRO_GIRLBOY>.  What did you say your name was?~
@47  = ~I'm <CHARNAME>.~
@48  = ~I'm Elminster.~
@49  = ~I'm Drizzt.~
@50  = ~Pleased to meet you, <CHARNAME>.  All right, <CHARNAME>, why don't you take this stack of scrolls and look them over.  When you have studied them well enough, let me know and I'll teach you about dragons... no, I'll teach you how to scribe scrolls.  Just don't take to long; otherwise I might forget what I was doing and leave.~
@51  = ~Pleased to meet you, Elminster.  All right, Elminster, why don't you take this stack of scrolls and look them over.  When you have studied them well enough, let me know and I'll teach you about dragons... no, I'll teach you how to scribe scrolls.  Just don't take to long; otherwise I might forget what I was doing and leave.~
@52  = ~Pleased to meet you, Drizzt.  All right, Drizzt, why don't you take this stack of scrolls and look them over.  When you have studied them well enough, let me know and I'll teach you about dragons... no, I'll teach you how to scribe scrolls.  Just don't take to long; otherwise I might forget what I was doing and leave.~
@53  = ~Yes, I guess that would be a proper hypothesis, but I suppose it could be argued either way.  Oh, nevermind.  Let us get on with the lesson.~
@54  = ~Little <PRO_GIRLBOY>, you need to take scribing scrolls one step at a time.  Now, do you think reading is more important than writing, or writing more important than reading?~
@55  = ~Ummm...~
@56  = ~Oh.  Hello.  I didn't see you there.  What were you saying?~
@57  = ~I said, of course I can write you looney.~
@58  = ~Hello.  What do you need?~
@59  = ~Nothing from you.  Bye.~
@60  = ~I've studied the scrolls like you told me.~
@61  = ~Bye, <CHARNAME>.~
@62  = ~Bye, Mr. Elminster.~
@63  = ~Bye, Drizzt.~
@64  = ~Good.  So do you know what they said?~
@65  = ~Yes.~
@66  = ~No.~
@67  = ~Do you know what they mean?~
@68  = ~Could you copy them?~
@69  = ~Then there is one more test for me to teach you how to learn how to scribe scrolls.  This is the most important, even more important than reading or writing.~
@70  = ~It is the Sembian And Tethyr exam, conducted in places of learning around Faer√ªn.  Everyone gets the exact same Sembian And Tethyr exam, regardless of Race or Class, and it may be biased, but it is the only way for us to know if you have the aptitude for advanced scroll scribing.~
@71  = ~I will give you the test right now.  It has three multiple choice questions.  The first question is 

When scribing scrolls I should have:
~
@72  = ~Glue.~
@73  = ~Elephants.~
@74  = ~Parchment.~
@75  = ~A sword.~
@76  = ~Iron.~
@77  = ~I'm sorry, but that is wrong.  Let us go on to the next question.~
@78  = ~The question is:

When scribing a scroll of protection, I should have ______ colored ink.
~
@79  = ~Blue.~
@80  = ~Green.~
@81  = ~Permanent.~
@82  = ~Invisible.~
@83  = ~White.~
@84  = ~I'm sorry, but that is wrong.  Let us go on to the final question.~
@85  = ~The final question, for one million doll...  I mean, for the Scribe Scrolls skill, is:

If I scribe a scroll which is magical, I can:
~
@86  = ~Burn it.~
@87  = ~Drink it.~
@88  = ~Stab someone with it.~
@89  = ~Cast it.~
@90  = ~Use it as a blanket.~
@91  = ~I'm sorry, but that is wrong.~
@92  = ~You got enough answers correct that I can give you a diploma for learning how to scribe scrolls.~
@93  = ~I'm sorry, little <PRO_GIRLBOY>, but you didn't get enough of the questions right for me to bestow upon you a diploma for learning the Scribe Scrolls skill.  You'll have to wait until you get smarter to learn that skill.  Perhaps when you are older like me.~
@94  = ~That's right!~
@95  = ~That's right!  All right, let's give you the next question.~
@96  = ~That's right!  Let's ask the second question.~
@97  = ~You should study them more then.~
@98  = ~Well done, little <PRO_GIRLBOY>.  Here's your diploma, and now I must leave you.  Good luck with the rest of your studies here in Candlekeep.~
@99  = ~Good try, little <PRO_GIRLBOY>.  I'm sorry, but I must leave you.  Good luck with the rest of your studies here in Candlekeep.~
