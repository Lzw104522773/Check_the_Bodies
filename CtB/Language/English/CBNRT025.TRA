The Council of Northmen Elders, of whom I am working for in an attempt to gain acceptance within this tribe of barbarians and fighters, have given me another task to complete.  I am to journey overseas again, back to the city of Athkatla, where I am to attempt to locate, and remove, a threat which the Elders have sensed.  They are unsure of the exact location of this unknown threat, but know that it must be met before it can strike back at the people of good on Toril.~
@57 = ~Tribal Relations

I have encountered a tribe of Northmen:  semi-civilized people who inhabit the isolated island of Rauthym, hundreds of miles from Waterdeep and the Sword Coast.  They have told me if I wish to be accepted into their warrior society, I would have to perform a number of tasks.  The first task they have assigned me is to recover a Shaman's Staff, an object of minor magical ability, and return it to the Council of Elders as quickly as I can.~
@58 = ~Tribal Teachings

The Council of Elders on Rauthym have assisted me in becoming one of their tribe, this time by teaching me how to set a variety of traps and snares to capture or harm my enemies.~

@61 = ~Tribal Relations

As the Council of Northmen requested, I returned to the mainland where I was forced to face- and defeat- a powerful demon that had somehow found it's way from the ethereal planes to Faer√ªn.  When I returned to the island of Rauthym, I found that warmongering forces out of the northern Sword Coast city of Luskan, as they have for years, were once again making an attempt to conquer the island.  I was able to repel the invaders, and was rewarded by the Council of Elders after the Luskanite threat was defeated.~
@62 = ~Tribal Relations

I have been given yet another task by the Northmen Elders, this time I am to find the material to reforge a mighty warhammer.  When I have found the appropriate components, I am to bring them to the dwarf Cromwell in Athkatla to be reforged.~
@63 = ~Tribal Relations

After I was able to have Cromwell reforge the magical Hammer of Lokin, I returned it to the Council of Elders on Rauthym.  They rewarded me by bestowing additional magical properties upon the weapon and giving me the enchanted warhammer as a gift for my assistance to the Northmen tribe.  The Elders instructed me to use the hammer with honor.~
@64 = ~Tribal Teachings

For my assistance in completing the tasks the Northmen council assigned, they have taught me how to use any item I wish.~
@65 = ~Tribal Teachings

@68 = ~Tribal Teachings
